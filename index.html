                    I’m really bad at these things. Pehly tou socha tha kay will wish you in person yk hug krke and stuff. But boi do i suck at showing affection physically. And sincere apologies k 12 bajy nahi wish kiya I won’t lie i straight up forgot raat ko subha yaad aya and then I thought let’s piss her off first. It kinda made me sad too tho but i hope k you’ll like this and all that me being an asshole of a friend would pay off. So here’s to our journey:
                    
                    Was it 5 or 6 of feb the first day?? Ion remember but there comes a girl and asks my name and i straight up blurt miss umber bc i was thinking about her us waqt ew moment tha bhai. Mera naam arooj hai. Mera manahil. Ahahahhaah who knew huh. And yaha pe a k when i saw you for the first time then it clicked k man i have seen her    Issa compliment bc I don’t remember faces much. From the uni i saw you mostly with nabia and the other girls and honestly tbh sey hei i was really into your smile it was still it so cute. Even tho you never spared me a second glance now I wonder if you’d even looked at me accidentally. Ihy.  Khair getting to know you made up for the torture of al aziz. And the day in the bus when you extended your hand like a child and said “ lets be friends “ for a min i was in a stance k bitch I thought we’re already friends wym lets be friends but i gave you the benifit of the doubt bc you looked so innocent and cute I could barely keep my smile hidden. Well that frienship that was born that day officially bc I considered you one pehly hi. Idk i got blessed maybe? And yea cursed too with our qismatein aligning so much. It’s all bc of you k we suffer I’m a nice person. Narcism hogaya lol. Khair back to you. Welp you really are true to your name. Idk what it means tho but you real are the kind of person jis se baat krna asan hai. That makes you a really beautiful human. And I’m glad i met you. And should i be sorry for trauma dumping on you from time to time?? Aw hell nah. What i liked the most was you’re completely me but in a different more mature more defined font. Like i wanna be you when i grow up. I hope we stay friends for a long lonnng time. To sum it up. I haven’t willingly shared my fries with anyone (same gender) i was always guilted into it but with you I won’t mind sharing my fries ever. I love you so much dheeir sara payari. Allah tumary naseeb tumary es payari hassi se b zyda achy or haseen kry or tumko hamesha wo sabh mily jis ke tumhe chah hai or jo tumary haq mein hai.  Also don’t forget what i said us din do not ever question k you’re not worth ut or self doubt. Kabhi kabhi bas waqt hamary sath acha nahi hota bas. Or  han. kamyabi tumary qadam chume. (Bht hogaya es se zyda ni bolri mein)
                    
                    Anyways, 
                    Asmaan ishq hai na???
                    Mgr tum bhi asmaan sey kam nahi. <33
                    
                    Meri payari arooj <3333
                    With love,
                    Noorulmanahil.
